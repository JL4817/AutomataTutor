AutomataSim is a visualization and simulation tool for Deterministic (DEA) and Nondeterministic (NEA) Finite Automata built using Java.
It allows users to create, edit, and simulate automata through an intuitive graphical interface, making theory more interactive and understandable.

## About

Finite automata are a core concept in theoretical computer science, but they can be hard to grasp through symbols and transition tables alone.
Therefore, this project provides a visual and interactive way to understand how automata process input strings and transition between states.
It’s especially useful for students (like me!) who want to see automata in action rather than just read about them.

I developed this project mostly on my own, with only very little help from AI, to strengthen my understanding of automata and GUI programming in Java.

## Features

Build Deterministic (DEA) and Nondeterministic (NEA) automata via GUI

Add states, transitions, and input symbols interactively

Simulate automata step-by-step on given input strings

Visual feedback for accepted/rejected inputs

Intuitive and educational design for automata learning

Extendable for future support (e.g., ε-transitions, regex parsing, etc.)
